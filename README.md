BLITS (Ballistic Long-range Ignition Testing System)

The BLITS system integrates the Avionics STIS (Static Test Ignition System) functionality with advanced pressure and temperature data acquisition capabilities provided by the Hybrid committee. The BLITS software is designed to operate on a Raspberry Pi. The BLITS system Boombox interfaces with the Raspberry Pi via a single USB cable, delivering thrust, pressure, and temperature data. The Raspberry Pi efficiently processes and stores incoming data.

Communicating via Radio Frequency with the Avionics handheld Football, the BLITS system Boombox not only oversees the collection of rocketry motor test data but also handles the long-range communication between the test site and the viewing site.

This integrated system represents a fusion of the Avionics committee's Static Test Ignition System and the Hybrid committee's Hybrid Control System. Upon completion, it will offer compatibility for deployment in solid motor tests, hybrid motor tests, and the strand burner project.
